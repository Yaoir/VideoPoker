A text-based video poker for Linux.

Many variants of video poker found in casinos are included as options.

The cards can be displayed as black or color characters, and also as Unicode
card faces.

It's a great way to practice your strategy for fun, or before going to a casino.
The text-based playing action allows for quick play and more rapid training than
with a GUI application.

If anyone would like to help develop a Qt-based GUI version, please let me know!

I'd also like to get this into the Debian and other package repositories if
possible. I've already done some of the work on that. If you are a package
maintainer for any Linux distribution, please contact me.
